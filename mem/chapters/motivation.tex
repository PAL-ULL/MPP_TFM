\section{Description of the Master thesis}

The main purpose of this Master thesis it is to develop an algorithm and analyse its performance solving the well-known Menu Planning Problem in order to compared it with other state-of-art algorithms. Nowadays, the Menu Planning Problem it is truly popular due the unfortunate increase of diseases related with the population's alimentary habits. For that reason, we can found many studies with different approaches and some real-world cases focused on developing menu-plans for school cafeterias or other public services.

Although there are a lot of different kind of algorithms for solving such a problem, a high percentage of published papers use evolutionary algorithm approaches or any other type of meta-heuristics due its large benefits like robustness, reliability, global-search ability and its simplicity. Therefore, this thesis it is focused on develop, analysis and comparison of an evolutionary algorithm for solving the Menu Planning Problem with other evolutionary algorithms 
using a real world case.
