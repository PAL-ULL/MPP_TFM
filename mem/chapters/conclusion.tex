\section{Conclusions and future work}

As seen in Chapter \ref{ref:results}, NSGA-II still being the state-of-art in Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms due to it outperforms both SPEA-2 and MOEA/D not only with high quality results but also with the faster ones for this novel MPP formulation.

Regarding MOEA/D algorithm, the quite simple version developed for this Master Thesis does not obtain as high quality solutions as NSGA-II or SPEA-2 do but it may be considered the reduction of evaluations done in order to achieve faster results. In the experimental evaluation explained in Chapter \ref{ref:results}, the population size and neighbourhood size seems not to have a high impact into the perfomance of the MOEA/D algorithm as it can be appreciated in the ranking from the preliminary experimental evaluation in Table \ref{ranking}. 


For further work, considering a new approach for initial weight generation may be a interesting choice as well as a more depth experimental evaluation with MOEA/D considering the mutation and crossover probability rate and increasing the evaluation limit to 4e8 evaluations as previous authors done in \cite{Miranda2018}.
