\section{Conclusions and future work}

As seen in Chapter \ref{ref:results}, NSGA-II still being the state-of-art in Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms since it outperforms both SPEA-2 and MOEA/D with statistically significant differences for this recently proposed MPP formulation.

Regarding MOEA/D algorithm, the quite simple version developed for this Master Thesis does not obtain as high quality solutions as NSGA-II or SPEA-2. In the experimental evaluation explained in Chapter \ref{ref:results}, the population size and neighbourhood size seems not to have a high impact into the perfomance of the MOEA/D algorithm as it can be appreciated in the ranking from the preliminary experimental evaluation in Table \ref{ranking}. 

For further work, considering a new approach for initial weight generation may be a interesting choice as well as a more depth experimental evaluation with MOEA/D considering the mutation and crossover probability rate and increasing the evaluation limit to 4e8 evaluations.
